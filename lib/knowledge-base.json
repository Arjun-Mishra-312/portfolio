    },
    "proj-4": {
      "question": "What's your biggest technical challenge?",
      "answer": "My biggest technical challenge was solving the 'cost vs. accuracy' dilemma for the AI Accessibility Analyzer I built at SOCIUS Lab. We needed to use powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to visually inspect web elements, but running high-end models like Claude 4.5 Sonnet on every DOM element was prohibitively expensive. I had to re-engineer the inference pipeline to be smarter. I implemented a hybrid strategy that utilized token management and optimized prompt engineering (like Chain-of-Thought and ReAct) to maximize the model's focus. The result was a 35% reduction in per-page inference costs without sacrificing F1 scores or Recall. Additionally, I developed a three-stage protocol that decomposes accessibility evaluation into focused analysis passes, reducing hallucination and improving grounding by constraining model attention to criterion-specific contexts."
    },
    "proj-5": {
      "question": "Which project taught you the most?",
      "answer": "The AI Policy Aggregator taught me the most about production engineering and system design. Over five months of development, I learned to balance multiple concerns: building a two-stage anti-hallucination system that ensures 100% source attribution, implementing semantic search with query expansion that improved relevance by 40%, and maintaining production quality with 296 comprehensive tests. The project required integrating heterogeneous sources (PDFs, APIs, HTML pages), building a scalable FastAPI backend, deploying to AWS, and creating a React 19 frontend with Firebase authentication. I learned that eliminating hallucinations in high-stakes domains requires systematic architecture, not just prompt engineering. The two-stage approach combining semantic filtering with strict attribution prompting became a core design pattern I now apply to other RAG systems."

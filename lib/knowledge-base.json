This philosophy—that significant, impactful solutions are constructed from small, meaningful efforts—now defines my approach to every problem I solve in the industry."
    },
    "me-easter": {
      "question": "What's something nobody asks but should?",
      "answer": "In our fast-paced industry, the most common question is, 'Can you get this done?' But the question I wish people would ask is, 'How do you plan to get this done?' I place immense value on the research and scoping phase of any project. Whether I'm architecting complex internal tooling for an enterprise or tackling a massive LEGO Technic set, I believe the battle is won in the preparation. Thoroughly mapping out project parameters—or simply sorting your bricks before you build—might feel like slowing down initially, but it exponentially speeds up the execution. For me, a smoother, high-quality construction process always beats a rushed start."

      "question": "Tell me about your AI/ML projects",
      "answer": "My AI work is grounded in both building robust RAG pipelines and engineering custom model architectures. On the research side, I am deeply involved in multimodal learning. For my accessibility research, I built a custom PyTorch Multimodal Transformer that fuses text tokens with segmentation masks to predict WCAG violations. I also work heavily with Vision-Language Models, optimizing inference through techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting. In production environments, my focus shifts to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I have architected production-ready pipelines using LangChain, FastAPI, and ChromaDB, utilizing sentence-transformers for embeddings and OpenAI/Gemini for inference."
    },
    "proj-4": {
      "question": "What's your biggest technical challenge?",
      "answer": "My biggest technical challenge was solving the 'cost vs. accuracy' dilemma for the AI Accessibility Analyzer I built at SOCIUS Lab. We needed to use powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to visually inspect web elements, but running high-end models on every DOM element was prohibitively expensive. I had to re-engineer the inference pipeline to be smarter. I implemented a hybrid strategy that utilized token management and optimized prompt engineering (like Chain-of-Thought and ReAct) to maximize the model's focus. The result was a 35% reduction in per-page inference costs without sacrificing F1 scores or Recall."
    },
    "proj-5": {
      "question": "Which project taught you the most?",
      "answer": "Ableify has been my steepest learning curve because it required me to wear every hat: mobile engineer, backend architect, AI researcher, and security specialist. The biggest lesson came from implementing End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). Integrating military-grade encryption (AES-256-GCM) for user journals while simultaneously running a RAG-based AI agent was a massive engineering challenge—I had to ensure that the AI could provide 'contextually relevant' support without ever actually compromising the user's raw private data."
    },
    "proj-6": {
      "question": "What are you building right now?",

I am currently authoring a research proposal for ACM ASSETS 2026 titled 'How effective are VLMs for automated web accessibility evaluation vs. static analysis?'. My daily work involves running large-scale evaluations across thousands of data points and testing hybrid architectures."
    },
    "proj-easter": {
      "question": "What project idea keeps you up at night?",
      "answer": "I dream of building the 'Universal LEGO Architect.' Ideally, you would just snap a photo of a random pile of loose bricks, and an AI—powered by object detection and geometric constraint solving—would analyze your exact inventory. It would then generate step-by-step 3D instructions for a brand new model that you can build right now, optimized for the pieces you actually have. It’s the perfect intersection of my technical interests (Computer Vision, Graph Theory) and my personal obsession."
